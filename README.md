To run the evaluation script, two arguments are needed. The folder containing the gold data and the folder containing the systems. For each system, it is better to create a separate folder and place the prediction files there. 
  
  --Running the Evaluation Script:
  
  python evaluation.py --gold_folder "../eval_data/Gold/Default/Task1/" --test_folder "../eval_data/"
